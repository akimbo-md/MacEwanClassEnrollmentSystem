Yet, most scholarship and popular culture portray the Celtic regions of Britain in an undifferentiated manner. This course explores the unique histories of the Celtic regions of the British Isles as well as their shared cultural links and experiences within the region. Topics may include: Roman Britain, King Arthur, the Celtic Church, Picts and Dalriada, the Vikings, Strong Bow in Ireland, Manx Kingship, Owain Glyndwr, Kin Networks, Celtic Identity, Art and Language, Plantation and Colonialism, Resistance, and Incorporation.",

It also has a distinct political culture. The province has been governed by a series of political dynasties from the Liberals to UFA to Social Credit to the Conservatives.
